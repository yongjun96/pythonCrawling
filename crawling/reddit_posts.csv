제목 : What’s the difference between 물밖에 안 마셔요 vs 물밖에 못 마셔요,내용 : I’m unsure of the specific nuance between using 못 and 안 with 밖에,"안 and 못 meaning no!!
but little bit different

안 : don't (free will)
못 : can't (forcibly)댓글 : 
물밖에 못 마셔요 means I only can't drink anything else but water.
물밖에 안 마셔요 is acually not correct one even though most of the korean use such expression. This expression is used to say ""I only drink water"". To make it more precisely, you cab say 물만 마셔요.댓글 : 
Isn’t it something like I don’t and I can’t댓글 : 
밖에 못마시다 = can only drink 
밖에 안마시다= do only drink
You can use both but 못 more emphasizes ur ability(your limit). 안 is more like ur choice(ur decision)댓글 : 
It's based on whether you WILL NOT or CANNOT do something

_


안 would be used to say you WILL NOT and do not do it (By choice, or preference)

For example, you can drink Coffee, it doesn't affect your health, let's say... but you don't like Coffee or other beverages, and you prefer water over all of them

못 would be used to say you CANNOT (By ability, not choice)

For example, Coffee and other (available) beverages in the setting that you were given as options are those that you cannot drink.. Water is the only drink among the beverages that your body can handle..

_

Therefore,

물밖에 안 마셔요 = I DO NOT drink anything but water

물밖에 못 마셔요 = I CANNOT drink anything by water

_

Hope this helps"

제목 : Slang help,"내용 : I'm not sure if this is slang, but I'm trying to read a comic in Korean and came to the phrase, ""째실?"" What does this mean? 

For context they are responding to a friend talking about how difficuky class was","째실 basically means ‘do you wanna play hooky’. You can use this word at school, workplace, etc. So in that context, the characters are trying to skip the class or just dropping the course cuz they don’t like it댓글 : 
That makes sense, thank you so much!!"
제목 : Question! SUN is in I LOVE YOU,"내용 : The word sun (해 hae) is used in I love you. (사랑해요). Does anyone have any resources on why? Or on what the other individual characters might be if not just the hangul alphabet spelling things out. 

Thank you!","해 is like the korean version of the word ‘do’. 사랑해요 means I do love you which also means I love you. 해요 is a formal version of 하다, and you shouldn’t say 사랑하다 because ur not respecting ur partner and it doesn’t grammatically make sense when ur talking.댓글 : 
It is a homonym that can be clearly seen via hanja. Chinese character writing for Korean words.댓글 : 
Korean has some very short words like 손, 물, 해, 목, 코, 뒤, etc. Sometimes, looking at the smaller syllables in a bigger words can help catch their meaning, like for 손목, which literally means ""the hand's neck"" aka the wrist. However, it is not always the case. 물 means ""water"". Well, in 물고기 (fish), it is linked to the word's meaning (literally ""water meat""), but in 박물관 (museum), I'm pretty confident it has no link at all. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't. Be careful with that.

As for 사랑해, its base form is 사랑하다, meaning literally ""to do love"" aka ""to love"". In this case, 해 doesn't mean sun.댓글 :

제목 : Becoming fluent in Korean starting later in life?,"내용 : Do any of you have experience with this? I'm in my late 30s, Korean on my mother's side, with very little knowledge of the language. My mother has always been very cagey about our family history and life in Korea so I never had a sense of feeling connected to that ancestry until much later in life. 

One of my dreams is to travel to Korea where my mom's family is from and attempt to investigate some family history and I was wondering if I'd ever be able to fluently communicate in Korean. Is this a reasonable pursuit?","Guess what! I’m about to turn 71 and I started learning Korean six months ago. Sometimes it feels like I’m writing a vocabulary word on water. It’s there then it’s gone, but I keep trying. I have noticed that my learning ability has become more fluid over the months. My brain is softening, becoming more absorbent, and my synapses are firing better. It’s taking a long time, but I love it so much. You can do anything you put your mind to - trust me on that, Young One.댓글 : 
The best age for language learning is up until you are 18 (MIT, 2018), but it is always possible to learn a new language no matter your age! Adults can be quick at learning new languages, but the difficulty lies in getting to a proficiency level similar to a native speaker. However, that goal is obtainable if you study hard & practice practice practice:) 

Bottom line, it’s never too late to learn a language, but it will be more work as you get older. 

You’ve got this! Best of luck, and I hope in time you can find the answers you are looking for:)댓글 : 
48 have been learning for 3 years am also learning Chinese.  No age is too old to learn a language the hardest part is finding time to actually study at my age. I compensate by only watching Chinese and Korean drama EVERY day. That way I am learning while relaxing too. Being in your 30s is not old or late. The best time to start is now댓글 : 
I'm 64 and just started learning Korean on April 22, once a week, 1.5 hour classes.  I've had 6 classes and I've surprised myself with how much I've progressed from zero.  I tried to teach myself and didn't get far.  Now I take a class on Zoom.  I love it.  You can do it.댓글 :

제목 : noun modifmodifying form ㄴ/은/는,내용 : I’ve recently been going over new grammar topics and I’m still confused on noun modifying form. Why are we modifying the noun?? I feel like everything I’ve read leaves me more confused. For example I know that 여쁘다 꽃would be 여쁜 꽃 for “pretty flowers” but why do that instead of just saying “꽃은 예뻐요.“ ?

Hello, the direct translation would be “while leaning on mooryangsoojun entasis”. This is poetic title conveying the concept and feeling of the book.

In Vietnamese it is diem tam and means ""breakfast"". Apparently the lunch meaning came through Eastern Chinese dialects, as in the Shanghai dialect ti xin, is often used for ""lunch"".

제목 : Need advice for a Korean main character’s name!!,"내용 : Hi! Im working on a science fiction novel that’s been evolving for several years now. The character started as a Korean-American woman named Ryn which I later changed to Rin (dad was sci-fi future American navy and mum was Korean, born and raised in Korea). Eventually I hit a brick wall with her as a character and realized that they’d been screaming at me for years that they were actually a trans man.
So cue the last year and I’ve been writing “Rin” as a trans man. Except I realized that I should double check the presence of Rin in Korean masculine naming conventions. The research I’ve done shows Rin is seems to be a majority feminine name which is definitely not something the character would want, but sometimes can be masculine? I’m fairly attached the name Rin bc that’s what he’s always been but I also don’t want to so blatantly contradict Korean naming conventions.
Tentatively I have his full name as Seok-Rin Cooper but what I’m looking for is advice from Korean peoples on this specifically. Is Rin too obviously a feminine name? Any and all commentary and help on this would be great.","For given names with the second syllable ""-rin"" (린), I think of Harin (하린) and Arin (아린), which are feminine sounding in my opinion.

Seokrin (석린) is an uncommon name imo, and keep in mind that it would be pronounced by a Korean more like Seongnin (성닌) because of Korean pronunciation conventions around a syllable ending with ㄱ and followed by ㄹ.

Seokjin (석진) could be an alternative as it's a fairly common and masculine sounding name.댓글 :

While I can teach every level of Korean, my agenda will always focus on the fundamentals and basics of korean alphabets because of a wide range of variations and expressions you can choose to speak/ write. the ultimate goal is to have you actually be able to have a conversation in Korean. We can also watch netflix kdrama or listening to kpop together (virtually) and understand everything about it :) comment or message me if interested!","[deleted]댓글 :

제목 : Translating Lyric Split,"내용 : Hi! So I'm planning to get some Korean lyrics tattooed to my arm, and I was wondering if it'd still translate properly if I split the lyrics?

The lyrics I'm going for are: '내가 네 곁을 지킬게 영원한 시간으로' which translates to 'I'll be by your side throughout the endless times'.

So if I put it like this:

내가 네 곁을 지킬게

영원한 시간으로

Would it still translate the same?","Yes, this kind of splitting should be fine. It makes sense as the first part ''내가 네 곁을 지킬게"" can actually be a complete sentence (meaning = I'll be by your side).댓글 : 
Thanks for the response!

If you don't mind, could you answer this one for me too?

Another set of lyrics I might be going for is: '우린 늘 그렇듯 웃음꽃 피워요' (Just like always, our smile flowers will bloom).

If I split it like this:

우린 늘 그렇듯

웃음꽃 피워요

Do you think it'd still translate the same?

Bear in mind that there's a possibility that there'd be a larger tattoo (of flowers) in between the two lyrics to resemble the said 'smile flowers'.댓글 : 
Yes, this kind of split is okay as well :)댓글 :
